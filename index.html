        <p> I am originally from Philadelphia, PA, but currently reside in Utah near Salt Lake City. Before getting into development, I was employed in several industries, including:
        </p>
        <ul> <!-- Unorganized list of prior experience -->
          <li>Biological Research</li>
          <li>Construction Management</li>
          <li>Engineering</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h2 style="text-align: center"><b>More Info</b></h2>

          <p>While I had coded previously, I did not end up in development through the most direct route, studying biology at the University of Pennsylvania before spending some years working in a few different industries. I made my way into development because I've always wanted to be able to make websites to showcase some of my personal projects, and when I did I found that I really enjoy the hands-on aspects of being able to write, design & create programs & sites myself. Off the computer, I enjoy music festivals, traveling, reading & hiking - the mountains being one of the main reasons I love living in Salt Lake. I am always looking to continue educating myself, and would love to hear from fellow developers - feel free to reach out/follow me at the following:</p>
